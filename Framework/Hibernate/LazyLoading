Hibernate, by default, consider all *ToOne relations, as EAGER and the only way to configure *ToOne with Lazy loading is to use the annotation @LazyToOne(LazyToOneOption.NO_PROXY) in conjunction with hibernate compile instrumentation.

Thatâ€™s only true for parent-side @OneToOne(mappedBy="parent"). Client-side @OneToOne and @ManyToOne can be load lazily by setting the fetch attribute to FetchType.LAZY.
